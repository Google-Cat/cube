# Tetris: the game
It's literally my first program written in Java.
This program is an implementation of the popular tetris game. It is controlled by arrows on the keyboard. The interface is built on the basis of built-in Java libraries.
I hope that for someone this experience will be useful and inspire them to further learn about the world of programming, as it once was for me.

## Acknowledgements
I also would like to thank @Adamovskiy and @mymargaret for their support during the development of this program.
